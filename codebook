The dataset was downloaded and extracted under the folder called "UCI HAR Dataset"

There are comments throughout the code that details how the code is working and all variables involved.

Also, see the readme.txt attached as more detail is given there. This seems redundant. 

##Directions are the following:
## 1. Merge the training and test sets to create one data set
## 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviations for each measurement
## 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## 4. Label the data set with descriptive variable names
## 5. From the data set in step 4, create a second independent tidy data set with the average of each 
##    variable for each activity and each subject


## We have three variables:
## - Activity
## - Subject
## - Features
