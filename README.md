# GettingCleaningData

The run_analysis.R script perfroms the 5 stesp as described in the assignment. Summarized below:

## 1. Merge the training and test sets to create one data set
## 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviations for each measurement
## 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## 4. Label the data set with descriptive variable names
## 5. From the data set in step 4, create a second independent tidy data set with the average of each 
##    variable for each activity and each subject

Each data was assigned to the variables features, activities, and subject. 

There are comments throughout the script that describe in detail what the code is doing.

The training and test data sets were merged and means and standard deviations were extracted. 

Activity names were modified to be more descriptive as presribed by the principles of tidy data.
